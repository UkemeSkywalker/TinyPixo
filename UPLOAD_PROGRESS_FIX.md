# Upload Progress Fix

## Problem

The frontend upload progress bar was stuck at 0% during file uploads, even though the backend was correctly tracking and logging upload progress in real-time. Users couldn't see the actual upload progress for large files.

## Root Cause

The frontend was only setting upload progress to 100% after the entire upload completed, but wasn't polling for intermediate progress during the upload process. The backend was storing detailed progress information in Redis, but the frontend wasn't consuming it.

## Solution

### Backend Changes

1. **Created Upload Progress API (`app/api/upload-progress/route.ts`)**:

   - New endpoint to retrieve upload progress from Redis
   - Returns simplified progress data with percentage, chunks, and stage
   - Proper caching headers to prevent stale data

2. **Modified Upload API (`app/api/upload-audio/route.ts`)**:
   - Accept optional `fileId` from frontend form data
   - Use provided fileId for consistent progress tracking
   - Fallback to generated fileId if not provided

### Frontend Changes (`app/audio-converter/page.tsx`)

1. **Pre-generate FileId**: Generate unique fileId before starting upload for consistent tracking

2. **Progress Polling**:

   - Poll upload progress API every 750ms for files >5MB
   - Start polling after 1-second delay to allow upload initialization
   - Cap progress at 99% until upload fully completes

3. **Error Handling**:

   - Retry logic for failed progress requests
   - Handle 404 responses (upload not started yet)
   - Stop polling after multiple failures
   - Graceful degradation if progress tracking fails

4. **User Experience**:
   - Real-time progress updates during upload
   - Chunk-based progress information
   - Smooth progress bar animation

## Technical Details

### Progress Data Flow

1. Frontend generates `fileId` and starts upload with it
2. Backend stores progress in Redis with key `upload:${fileId}`
3. Frontend polls `/api/upload-progress?fileId=${fileId}` during upload
4. Progress updates in real-time as chunks are uploaded
5. Progress reaches 100% when upload completes

### Progress Data Structure

```typescript
{
  fileId: string;
  fileName: string;
  progress: number; // 0-100 percentage
  uploadedSize: number; // Bytes uploaded
  totalSize: number; // Total file size
  completedChunks: number; // Chunks completed
  totalChunks: number; // Total chunks
  stage: "uploading" | "completed";
}
```

## Expected Behavior

- Upload progress bar shows real-time progress for large files (>5MB)
- Small files (<5MB) upload quickly without chunking
- Progress updates smoothly from 0% to 100%
- Users can see chunk-based progress in console logs
- Graceful handling of network issues during progress polling

## Files Modified

- `app/api/upload-progress/route.ts` - New upload progress API
- `app/api/upload-audio/route.ts` - Accept fileId from frontend
- `app/audio-converter/page.tsx` - Real-time progress polling

## Testing

- Created test script to validate progress tracking
- Verified API response structure and data flow
- Tested error handling and edge cases

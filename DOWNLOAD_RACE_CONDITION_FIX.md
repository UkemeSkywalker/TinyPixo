# Download Race Condition Fix

## Problem
The audio converter was experiencing a race condition where:
1. Progress reached 100% in Redis (via `progressService.markComplete()`)
2. Frontend immediately tried to download the file
3. Download endpoint checked job status in DynamoDB (still not COMPLETED due to eventual consistency)
4. Download failed with "Conversion not completed yet" error

## Root Cause
The conversion completion flow was:
1. `updateJobStatus(jobId, JobStatus.COMPLETED, ...)` - Updates DynamoDB
2. 100ms delay for DynamoDB consistency  
3. `progressService.markComplete(jobId)` - Updates Redis with 100% progress

But the frontend was polling Redis (fast) and immediately downloading when progress reached 100%, while the download endpoint was checking DynamoDB (slower due to eventual consistency).

## Solution

### Frontend Changes (`app/audio-converter/page.tsx`)

1. **Enhanced Polling Logic**: Changed from checking only `progress >= 100` to checking both `progress >= 100 AND stage === 'completed'`
   ```typescript
   // Before
   if (data.progress >= 100) {
   
   // After  
   if (data.progress >= 100 && data.stage === 'completed') {
   ```

2. **Improved Download Retry Logic**: 
   - Increased max retries from 5 to 8
   - Added exponential backoff with jitter (500ms base, up to 3s max)
   - Better error handling for race conditions

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced Conversion API (`app/api/convert-audio/route.ts`)**:
   - Increased DynamoDB consistency delay from 100ms to 250ms
   - Added job status verification before marking progress complete
   - Added retry logic if verification fails

2. **Improved Download API (`app/api/download/route.ts`)**:
   - Better error messages for different job statuses
   - More specific status codes and error descriptions

## Testing
- Created test scripts to validate the fix
- All test scenarios pass, confirming the race condition is resolved

## Expected Behavior
- Frontend now waits for both progress completion AND job status consistency
- Download attempts are more resilient with better retry logic
- Users should no longer see "Conversion not completed yet" errors
- Conversion flow is more reliable end-to-end

## Files Modified
- `app/audio-converter/page.tsx` - Frontend polling and download logic
- `app/api/convert-audio/route.ts` - Job completion flow
- `app/api/download/route.ts` - Download validation and error handling

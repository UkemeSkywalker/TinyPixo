## Posting Strategy Tips:

1. **Timing**: Post LinkedIn content during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) on weekdays. Twitter can be posted anytime but performs well during lunch hours and evenings.

2. **Hashtags**: Use 3-5 relevant hashtags on LinkedIn, 2-3 on Twitter for better engagement.

3. **Visuals**: Consider adding screenshots of the TinyPixo interface, before/after file size comparisons, or performance metrics.

4. **Engagement**: Respond to comments quickly and engage with others' content in your niche to boost visibility.

5. **Cross-posting**: Space out posts over 1-2 weeks rather than posting all at once to maintain momentum.

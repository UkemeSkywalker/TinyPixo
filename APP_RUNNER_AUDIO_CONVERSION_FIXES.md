# App Runner Audio Conversion Timeout Fixes

## Problem Analysis

The audio conversion feature was failing in AWS App Runner due to **request timeout issues**:

1. **App Runner Hard Limit**: 120-second timeout per HTTP request (cannot be changed)
2. **Progress Polling**: Frontend polls `/api/progress` every 500ms
3. **Timeout Chain**: If any progress poll hangs >120s → 502 error → frontend retries → progress resets
4. **Infinite Loop**: Progress reaches 100%, resets to 0%, gets stuck

## Root Cause

- Audio conversion works locally (no timeout constraints)
- In App Runner, long-running conversions cause progress polling requests to timeout
- Frontend retry logic causes progress to reset, creating an infinite loop
- The issue wasn't CPU/memory - it was **request timeout handling**

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. **Progress API Improvements** (`app/api/progress/route.ts`)
- Added cache-control headers to prevent response caching
- Ensured immediate response without blocking operations

### 2. **Smart Frontend Polling** (`app/audio-converter/page.tsx`)
- **Request Timeouts**: 30-second timeout on progress polls
- **Exponential Backoff**: Start at 500ms, increase to max 5s on failures
- **Retry Logic**: Max 10 attempts before giving up
- **Error Handling**: Proper cleanup on connection failures
- **Abort Controllers**: Prevent hanging requests

### 3. **Separate Download Endpoint** (`app/api/convert-audio/download/route.ts`)
- Decoupled file download from conversion process
- Prevents large file transfers from timing out during progress polling
- Automatic cleanup after successful download

### 4. **Conversion Process Protection** (`app/api/convert-audio/process/route.ts`)
- **Maximum Conversion Time**: 10-minute timeout per job
- **Proper Cleanup**: Clear timeouts on completion/failure
- **Memory Management**: Store output in memory temporarily

### 5. **System Maintenance** (`app/api/cleanup/route.ts`)
- Automatic cleanup of abandoned jobs (>30 minutes old)
- Prevents memory leaks from failed conversions
- Can be called manually or via cron job

### 6. **Health Monitoring** (`app/api/health/route.ts`)
- Monitor active conversion jobs
- Check FFmpeg availability
- Memory usage tracking
- System health status

### 7. **Testing Tools** (`test-audio-conversion.js`)
- Verify API response times
- Test timeout handling
- Validate endpoint availability

## Key Changes Summary

| Component | Change | Benefit |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Progress Polling | Exponential backoff + timeouts | Handles network issues gracefully |
| File Download | Separate endpoint | Prevents large transfers from timing out |
| Conversion Process | 10-minute max timeout | Prevents infinite hanging jobs |
| Error Handling | Proper cleanup + retries | Recovers from temporary failures |
| Memory Management | Automatic job cleanup | Prevents memory leaks |

## Deployment Checklist

1. ✅ Deploy updated code to App Runner
2. ✅ Test with various audio file sizes
3. ✅ Monitor `/api/health` endpoint
4. ✅ Set up periodic cleanup (optional cron job)
5. ✅ Monitor CloudWatch logs for timeout errors

## Expected Results

- **No more 502 errors** during audio conversion
- **Progress no longer resets** to 0%
- **Conversions complete successfully** even for large files
- **Graceful handling** of network interruptions
- **Automatic recovery** from temporary failures

## Monitoring

Use these endpoints to monitor the system:

- `GET /api/health` - System health and active jobs
- `POST /api/cleanup` - Manual cleanup of old jobs
- Check CloudWatch logs for timeout/error patterns

## Testing

Run the test script to verify fixes:

```bash
node test-audio-conversion.js
```

Or test with a specific URL:

```bash
TEST_URL=https://your-app-runner-url.com node test-audio-conversion.js
```

The fixes address the core App Runner timeout limitation by implementing proper async processing with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
